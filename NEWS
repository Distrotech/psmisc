Important NEWS for psmisc package
=================================

The command line for killall has changed significantly so it is more in
line with other programs.  To specify signals use the -s flag.
EG before version 20 you would do killall -HUP 123 now do
killall -s HUP 123

The license has changed to GPL for version 20 onwards with permission
of the original authors.  People who want to use these programs under
the previous license will have to look at psmisc 19 or below.
